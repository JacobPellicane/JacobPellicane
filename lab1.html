    <h2>What are Nothern Lights?</h2>
    <p>The northern lights, or aurora borealis, are a cool, colorful light display that can be seen in the night sky in the northern hemisphere. The name for auroras that appear in the southern hemisphere is aurora australis, or the southern lights.
        Both the northern and southern lights are called polar lights, or aurora polaris, since they happen near Earth's magnetic poles.</p>
